This is the manual test suite for the PDF extension.

## Running tests

In the `test` folder:

- Install the most recently built extension by running `bin/install_extension.sh`
- Run `box start`. This should open a browser to the test suite page.
- Scroll down the page and make sure that each PDF looks like the reference image.
